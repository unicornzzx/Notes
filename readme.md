## Notebook

This repository contains my learning notes since the third year of my undergraduate study. Some of them are in English, some of them are 
in both Chinese and English.


I use Youdao Notebook, from Netease company, to take my digital learning notes. At the begining, I took notes by using their special file format (**.ynt**). After half of a semester, I found ynt notes are very weak at sharing, they are incompatible with most of other notebook applications. I'm not willing to be hooked by Netease application environment. Thus, I decided take markdown notes (Youdao Notebook is a good markdown writting tool).
